## Introduction

This repository contains all my work for the Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.

## Project Overview

Automated text generation is becoming increasingly common. From robot journalism to product descriptions, their use has
become more and more ubiquitous. As demand continues to grow for individual online content, automated text generation
is to become increasingly important.

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset
of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it
recognizes in this training data.

## Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn (v0.17)](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and
more included.

## Neccessary Files
